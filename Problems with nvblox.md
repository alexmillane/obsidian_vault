A list of things that are wrong with nvblox as I come across them

Dichotomy between dynamic and static
- We get into a segmentation spiral
- Imperfect segmentation causes issues

Decay shenanigins
- We have to decay to make dynamics work, but this degrades the static map
- because of imperfect segmentation we have to decay both the static and the dynamic map.
