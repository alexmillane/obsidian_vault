## Get is running on hemals jetson
First I checked out a new branch with the topic names changed and then ran:

```bash
ros2 run nvblox_performance_measurement run_benchmark.py --realsense rosbag2_2022_12_08-02_39_16/
```

Which runs the performance on the MVP3 bag. I chose this bag because is has `/tf` in it. Which is apparently needed for the performance node.
