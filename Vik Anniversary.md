Please join me in congratulating Vikram on his 1-year anniversary at NVIDIA.

Since joining, Vik has led the charge on the integration of human detections into nvblox. After initially using a pre-trained network, Vikram worked on fine-tuning the network for robotics data. That model was released with the last Isaac ROS release.

Vikram has been the PIC for simulation related work in the nvblox team. We leverage his work here for testing navigation stack in the presence of moving people and objects in simulation.

Vik's a pleasure to work with and a big contributor to the team.





## Remo
Please join me in congratulating Remo on his 1-year anniversary at NVIDIA.

Since joining us Remo has led the charge on motion detection on the 3D perception team. Remo implemented and evaluated several approaches, based firstly on frame-to-frame image warping, and more recently on a more modern approach that leverages our GPU-resident voxel map. This approach is producing excellent results and will be released in Isaac ROS 2.0 in a few weeks. It is likely the first open-source 3D mapping package integrating GPU-accelerated motion detection.

In addition, Remo has contributed to the effort to integrate nvBlox into the Isaac AMR E2E navigation stack. Remo has played a big part in the steady improvement in performance and reliability of the system that we've seen there.

As anyone who has interacted with Remo will know, he's a pleasure to work with and a great asset to the Isaac team.
