# Allocators
`UnboundedAllocator` is not simply a wrapper around `new`.

Firstly the default value for the memory type is `kHost`. `kHost` means *pinned* CUDA memory. 

If you allocated CUDA memory (including `kHost`) internally the allocator
* **Allocate**
	* Locks a mutex
	* Allocates
	* Pushes the pointer into a set containing the currently allocated chunks
* **Deallocate**
	* Locks a mutex
	* Searches the pointer in a set
	* Deallocates
