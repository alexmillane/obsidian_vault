Data replay **app**: `apps/amr/data_recorder/data_replayer.yaml`

Apps:
``//apps/amr/data_recorder:data_replayer.yaml`

Subgraphs:
`apps/amr/data_recorder/subgraph/replayer.yaml`

## To use replayer subgraph
in `data` we need `//apps/amr/data_recorder/subgraphs:subgraphs`


## What to do
1) get dataset replayer running
2) copy app graph in nvblox
3) get it compiling lol
4) and running lol lol<
5) Introduce broadcast to duplicate our inputs/replayer outputs
6) Add in nvblox. Get inspiration from nvblox_dataset main.yaml
	1) Look at connections at bottom of file.
7) Create bullshit frames in the ATLAS
	1) copy paste from nvblox_dataset_loader frame creation
	2) paste into 
8) Sight visualization subgraph exists
	1) use the subgraph 
	2) and connect only mesh and esdf.

## What to do next
1) Get the odometry subgraph in
2) Get the nvblox subgraph in
3) drag in `carter2_frames.subgraph` Do this after just manually defining frames
